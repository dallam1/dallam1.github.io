### Update 21st June 2020

Welcome to the Dallam 1 2020 Virtual Venture.

Due to the exceptional circumstances surrounding COVID-19, CPAS made the difficult decision to cancel all residential Ventures this summer.

However, we are excited to offer you the opportunity to be involved in the inaugural Dallam 1 Virtual Venture. From Tuesday 4th to Thursday 6th August (during the week we would all have been at Dallam), we will be offering a variety of live and pre-recorded opportunities for you to join in with, via Zoom and YouTube. More details, including how to book, on all of this to be released very soon.
