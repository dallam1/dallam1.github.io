I have concentrated on comedy, as there is enough bleak news around!  Friday Night Dinner, Peter Kay's Car Share, The IT crowd, Gavin and Stacy, and American shows like Black-ish and Brooklyn Nine-nine!  I have enjoyed watching many of the Musicals and Plays that have been shown online too! Lockdown Low: A sad time - just before lockdown my Nan died.  She was a wonderful woman of God who I loved very much.  There are some cultural traditions that we couldn't observe because of lockdown restrictions, and we couldn't have many people attend her funeral, but as a family we honoured her, we live streamed the funeral via Zoom for those who weren't able to be with us, and while it was a small homegoing service, we will continue to remember her fondly and will host a memorial service when we are able. What is God saying?   "Whose are you"...  A very special woman told me this and especially in tough times it is important to me to take time and pray, and listen, and BREATHE...  I am blessed and continued to work throughout the pandemic, even though my work had been greatly affected (I am a youth worker, and not easy to do this when schools and youth clubs are closed), and I felt for a while as though I had to prove my existence and worth, especially as so many colleagues had been furloughed.  During [Thy Kingdom Come](https://www.thykingdomcome.global/), God really spoke to me and I was reminded that I am his, and I don't need to prove myself to anyone except him.

We have a lot of blackbirds around and their singing was amazing. God’s world is amazing! My Lockdown Low – having to cancel ‘real’ Dallam – I enjoy the Dallam week so much each year. Also seeing the effect of lockdown on my Daughter, Jane, who has ME and whom we care for. Somehow her isolation has been particularly hard to bear, even though it’s pretty well normal for her all the time. What has God been saying? – I’m here for you.

We've spent most of lockdown chasing around Isaac who has now started to crawl! Our lockdown high has been all the time we have been able to spend together as a family! We have found not being able to see friends and family really hard and it has definitely been our lock down low.
