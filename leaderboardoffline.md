I have concentrated on comedy, as there is enough bleak news around!  Friday Night Dinner, Peter Kay's Car Share, The IT crowd, Gavin and Stacy, and American shows like Black-ish and Brooklyn Nine-nine!  I have enjoyed watching many of the Musicals and Plays that have been shown online too! Lockdown Low: A sad time - just before lockdown my Nan died.  She was a wonderful woman of God who I loved very much.  There are some cultural traditions that we couldn't observe because of lockdown restrictions, and we couldn't have many people attend her funeral, but as a family we honoured her, we live streamed the funeral via Zoom for those who weren't able to be with us, and while it was a small homegoing service, we will continue to remember her fondly and will host a memorial service when we are able. What is God saying?   "Whose are you"...  A very special woman told me this and especially in tough times it is important to me to take time and pray, and listen, and BREATHE...  I am blessed and continued to work throughout the pandemic, even though my work had been greatly affected (I am a youth worker, and not easy to do this when schools and youth clubs are closed), and I felt for a while as though I had to prove my existence and worth, especially as so many colleagues had been furloughed.  During [Thy Kingdom Come](https://www.thykingdomcome.global/), God really spoke to me and I was reminded that I am his, and I don't need to prove myself to anyone except him.

We have a lot of blackbirds around and their singing was amazing. God’s world is amazing! My Lockdown Low – having to cancel ‘real’ Dallam – I enjoy the Dallam week so much each year. Also seeing the effect of lockdown on my Daughter, Jane, who has ME and whom we care for. Somehow her isolation has been particularly hard to bear, even though it’s pretty well normal for her all the time. What has God been saying? – I’m here for you.

We've spent most of lockdown chasing around Isaac who has now started to crawl! Our lockdown high has been all the time we have been able to spend together as a family! We have found not being able to see friends and family really hard and it has definitely been our lock down low.

Hattie Griggs

Jack Bacon

<img src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/gr7zot5v5pitows/jack.jpg?raw=1" width="2400"> | Hi, my name is Jack (on the right in the photo) and I’m thrilled to be helping out with Dallam this year, odd as it may be! I’ve been part of this Venture for a decade now, first as a member, then as a helper and now as a leader. I’m really looking forward to getting to know God with everyone in a different way this year. In my day job I work in communications for the Diocese of Leeds, who support lots of churches in West Yorkshire and the Dales. My lockdown high has been helping out with my church’s music in this time, providing drums for songs we have recorded and put together. It’s been great fun, and helped me improve my drumming, which I’ve really enjoyed! My lockdown low has been the inability to see people- I’m quite a social person, so not being able to hang out with my friends in the nice weather has been a bit demoralising. What is God saying? The Bible passage that has really spoken to me during this time has been Luke 4: 1-13, about Jesus in the wilderness. I’ll be talking about why this week!

Jenny Warrington

Lockdown high: Really enjoyed getting to know people on video calls that I’ve not talked to in depth before. Lockdown low: Not seeing our son and daughter and especially our new grandson. Missing hugs.

Ollie Greenfield

<img src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/vlrnyacuuazhf81/ollie2.jpg?raw=1" width="600"> | Lockdown High: Nothing can get in the way and stop our desire to stand up for what is right. I have been so encouraged to witness the BLM movement that has been so vocal even in lockdown times, and the change it has already begun to make in our society.
Also, Liverpool winning the league for the first time in 30 years has been a great lockdown high!!! YNWA! Lockdown Low: One of the hardest things this lockdown has been the separation from my new nephew, Isaac. He has nearly doubled in age since lockdown began! Seeing pictures and videos has been great, and occasional visits does help, but not being able to hold him and play with him has been hard. What God has been saying?  Over lockdown I have felt God saying that we are not alone. Which seems ironic considering that we have literally been separated from most people in our lives. But actually God is right, shocking I know! I have been reminded of how many people are still around me and contactable even if I can’t see them in person. But more importantly, God has kept reminding me that He is still around. There is so much over lockdown happening, getting used to a new way of living, new distractions around. It has been easier than ever for me to forget God. But thankfully, God has not forgotten me.
