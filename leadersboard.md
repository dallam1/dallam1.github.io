# Virtual Leaders Board

I have concentrated on comedy, as there is enough bleak news around!  Friday Night Dinner, Peter Kay's Car Share, The IT crowd, Gavin and Stacy, and American shows like Black-ish and Brooklyn Nine-nine!  I have enjoyed watching many of the Musicals and Plays that have been shown online too! Lockdown Low: A sad time - just before lockdown my Nan died.  She was a wonderful woman of God who I loved very much.  There are some cultural traditions that we couldn't observe because of lockdown restrictions, and we couldn't have many people attend her funeral, but as a family we honoured her, we live streamed the funeral via Zoom for those who weren't able to be with us, and while it was a small homegoing service, we will continue to remember her fondly and will host a memorial service when we are able. What is God saying?   "Whose are you"...  A very special woman told me this and especially in tough times it is important to me to take time and pray, and listen, and BREATHE...  I am blessed and continued to work throughout the pandemic, even though my work had been greatly affected (I am a youth worker, and not easy to do this when schools and youth clubs are closed), and I felt for a while as though I had to prove my existence and worth, especially as so many colleagues had been furloughed.  During [Thy Kingdom Come](https://www.thykingdomcome.global/), God really spoke to me and I was reminded that I am his, and I don't need to prove myself to anyone except him.

Carol Stewart

<img src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/jui4x39rdp3broy/carol.png?raw=1" width="1400"> | My Lockdown High – we are fortunate to live in the country and the spring was amazing, both in what we could see and in what we could hear, when the traffic largely disappeared. We have a lot of blackbirds around and their singing was amazing. God’s world is amazing! My Lockdown Low – having to cancel ‘real’ Dallam – I enjoy the Dallam week so much each year. Also seeing the effect of lockdown on my Daughter, Jane, who has ME and whom we care for. Somehow her isolation has been particularly hard to bear, even though it’s pretty well normal for her all the time. What has God been saying? – I’m here for you.

Cassie Beeson

<img src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/axwolqwxqudmt03/cassie7.jpg?raw=1" width="1000"> | Hello I'm Cassie. I had many Lockdown Highs; so much sleeping! Eating a lot of guilty pleasure food without anyone around to judge me. Time with my Cats, and starting the quilt project I've been intending to do for ages. Lockdown low; the worship pastor at my church is moving on to train to be a vicar, and instead of making the most of the short time we have left with him, we've been online. Goodbye zoom meetings with provide your own cakes aren't cutting the mustard. I felt that God was saying to me that he makes his joy accessible to us even through the trickiest of times. 

David and Karen Stewart

Emma and Edd Greenfield

<img src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/dlz37nbq7aslqob/emma%20and%20edd.jpg?raw=1" width="600"> | Hi, we're the Greenfields, Emma, Edd and Isaac. We've spent most of lockdown chasing around Isaac who has now started to crawl! Our lockdown high has been all the time we have been able to spend together as a family! We have found not being able to see friends and family really hard and it has definitely been our lock down low.

Hattie Griggs

<img src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/65oii1pe99pqq0s/hattie.jpg?raw=1" width="200"> | Lockdown high: slowing down and being thankful for little things. Lockdown low: not being able to hug loved ones.

Jack Bacon

<img src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/gr7zot5v5pitows/jack.jpg?raw=1" width="2400"> | Hi, my name is Jack (on the right in the photo) and I’m thrilled to be helping out with Dallam this year, odd as it may be! I’ve been part of this Venture for a decade now, first as a member, then as a helper and now as a leader. I’m really looking forward to getting to know God with everyone in a different way this year. In my day job I work in communications for the Diocese of Leeds, who support lots of churches in West Yorkshire and the Dales. My lockdown high has been helping out with my church’s music in this time, providing drums for songs we have recorded and put together. It’s been great fun, and helped me improve my drumming, which I’ve really enjoyed! My lockdown low has been the inability to see people- I’m quite a social person, so not being able to hang out with my friends in the nice weather has been a bit demoralising. What is God saying? The Bible passage that has really spoken to me during this time has been Luke 4: 1-13, about Jesus in the wilderness. I’ll be talking about why this week!

Jenny Warrington

<img src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/3k6iw2ewpva64bq/jenny.jpg?raw=1" width="800"> | I’m Jenny Warrington and I became the curate at All Saints Church in Chatham last October having been a GP for 25 years. Lockdown high: Really enjoyed getting to know people on video calls that I’ve not talked to in depth before. Lockdown low: Not seeing our son and daughter and especially our new grandson. Missing hugs.

Ollie Greenfield

<img src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/vlrnyacuuazhf81/ollie2.jpg?raw=1" width="3200"> | Lockdown High: Nothing can get in the way and stop our desire to stand up for what is right. I have been so encouraged to witness the BLM movement that has been so vocal even in lockdown times, and the change it has already begun to make in our society. Also, Liverpool winning the league for the first time in 30 years has been a great lockdown high!!! YNWA! Lockdown Low: One of the hardest things this lockdown has been the separation from my new nephew, Isaac. He has nearly doubled in age since lockdown began! Seeing pictures and videos has been great, and occasional visits does help, but not being able to hold him and play with him has been hard. What God has been saying?  Over lockdown I have felt God saying that we are not alone. Which seems ironic considering that we have literally been separated from most people in our lives. But actually God is right, shocking I know! I have been reminded of how many people are still around me and contactable even if I can’t see them in person. But more importantly, God has kept reminding me that He is still around. There is so much over lockdown happening, getting used to a new way of living, new distractions around. It has been easier than ever for me to forget God. But thankfully, God has not forgotten me.

Phil and Anna Tigg

<img src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/50lucfcf6ut7jq9/phil%20and%20anna.jpg?raw=1" width="450"> | Hi, we're Phil and Anna and these are our girls, Alex and Natasha. Lockdown high: Spending more time together as a family. Lockdown low: not being able to see friends and family.

Rachel Gannon

<img src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/qmzp7afvluocpym/rachie.png?raw=1" width="2400"> | Hi, I’m Rachel Gannon, I have been coming to this Venture for many years, and it is part of me and has shaped who I am as a Christian.  My first year was 1989 and the Venture has seen many changes since then, in both location and people serving on the team but God has remained ever constant and faithful to us as a Venture. For my day job, I work as an Administrator for a mental health charity called The Cellar Trust. Lockdown High: I’ve enjoyed the pace of life being slower and the time I have spent at home. Lockdown Low: Time away from seeing family and friends has been hard. Zoom time has been useful to stay in touch but it doesn’t compare with meeting up face-to-face. What is God saying?   A verse that I have clung on to recently is from Psalm 73 verse 23. “Yet I am always with you; you hold me by your right hand”. Our Minister at church preached on this and said.. “We are IN HIS GRIP”.  How amazing is that! 

Ruth Stewart

<img src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/zf1t4owri13jsv8/ruth2.jpg?raw=1" width="1500"> | Hello I'm Ruth Stewart (sister of David and Karen, aunt to Elodie and Finn, and daughter of Carol). I've been involved in the Venture for a very long time and love it a lot. Ventures were crucial to my faith when I was younger, and they’ve always been a highlight of my summer.  I consider many of the others involved my extended family! In between times I'm a teacher in Hounslow and live in Twickenham. I teach French and Spanish and run D of E at my school. Lockdown high: A slower pace of life, lots of time for gardening, reading and TV – Lockdown low:

Sandra Hall

<img src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/30hslyun0iw335l/sandra.jpg?raw=1" width="2200"> | Lockdown high: More space, no crowds, quieter roads, hearing the birds and seeing more insects. Lockdown low: Not being able to have face to face meetings with other people, too much time online. What I think God is saying in this time: The word equity has come to my attention a few times during recent months, both from scripture and other sources. I think God is giving the world an opportunity, as we reflect on the pandemic and the issues which it has raised, to make significant changes in our values. There is an urgent need to address the issues of poverty, deprivation, injustice, racism, hatred, prejudice and hopelessness. Human beings are created in God’s image and are all of equal value. In all societies, human lives should be placed at the highest value, way above wealth and power.

Sarah Williams

<img src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/gqdm3sa50hhn5qf/sarah%20w.jpg?raw=1" width="2600"> | Retired vicar, a Venture Leader somewhere or other since 1986. Lockdown High: I have loved being in our house in Faversham during this spring and summer. For the past 4 years at this time of year I have been sailing with my husband Rocyn in our boat (or yacht if you’re posh). I have loved watching the plants and flowers flourishing here. I have enjoyed the gardening, picnics, cycle rides. We feel so very blessed by God. Another high was giving a Bible to my hairdresser who has always asked me God/faith questions. Lockdown Low: The hard part has been the disappointment of cancelled visits, including my brother from New Zealand. What is God saying?   God is still at work, He is still the creator, upholding His creation and producing the bounty of the harvest around us. There is so much beauty and we need to look after it, and take responsibility for our actions.

Sid Rees

<img src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/phgb1ouw1w9zg9n/sid.jpg?raw=1" width="3000"> | Hi, I’m Sid, and I work for a Christian Charity who support Persecuted Christians WorldWide. I used to teach Geography. I like to spend time outdoors in God's creation and my happy place is the top of a mountain or on a gently flowing river. Lockdown for me meant shifting work from a bustling office to a very quiet study with just the cat for company. It also led to the postponement of some exciting expeditions. My lockdown low was the feeling of isolation and not being able to connect with people face-to-face daily, having to limit interactions to the computer. My lockdown high was getting to reflect on the busyness of life and taking time to slow down and potter, learning to appreciate God's rhythms and the necessity for Sabbath. I’ve been able to create a flower bed in my garden. I have also been very grateful for the development of technology so that I can connect with Friends and Family no matter where they are in the world.
